    "From the perspective of gaps in market offerings that a new development company could leverage to launch a successful initial product, we aim in this project to understand trends in popular mobile apps.  We will focus on behavior in the Google Play store and Apple iOS App store, and we will limit our attention to apps that are free to download and install.  Broadly speaking, we will not account for political, economic, social, or legal factors, hence only performing part of the environmental analysis that such a company should complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build our work on the assumption that visibility in the respective app stores is essential to success.  And, moreover, that visibility is a byproduct of algorithms that favor already popular apps.  We will utilize included data on app genre and categorization so that our hypthetical development company may focus on some subset of the app store that is popular with users but also possesses potential for small companies to get their footing.  For example, we will find that some categories are entirely dominated by large corporations, against which a small company would never be able to outspend nor outcompute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we will identify three areas in the Apple store (reference, health and beauty, and catalogs) and five areas in the Google store (health and fitness, house and home, art and design, personalization, and tools) in which a novel idea has the room to rise to a prominent position in the \"leaderboards.\"  The reasoning for including these and exluding other popular categories is included in the course of our discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "note: I acknowledge that my hypothetical premise of a new company looking to chase a trend to build an app is almost certainly not a very good recipe for the longevity of the company.  If you prefer, please replace this framework for one where an established company is trying to understand the structure of the marketplace and why their existing app is not being recommended often enough."

    "We see that, while this genre does contain outliers, they are unique in the service they provide and do not serve the broader needs of the category.  For the most part, once one moves beyond the top five apps, the remaining applications focus on reference features for popular media.  This creates some potential for a new app to exist in this space without worrying about pulling users away from the christian bible or dictionaries.  Secondly, based on the title offerings, there seems to be heavy correlation here with the popularity of the family genre, giving some indication of what topics have the potential to be successful within this genre.  Finally, it is reasonable to assume that such apps allow for more on-screen time and there are reasonable methods that can be employed to increase user engagement (e.g., tip of the day, rare tidbits, top 10 secrets).  All of the above in conjunction with our initial results in this section establishing the popularity of reference may result in an advantage for new developers to enter this space.  Contrast this to, say, weather, which is popular but is also dominated by outliers, has very little latitude for a unique value proposition, and lends itself to quick checks.\n",
